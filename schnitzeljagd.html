            <p>Schnitzeljagd is a movie/TV show filming location finding APP.
            </p>
            <p>This is a part of my Online course training, and I was in charge of doing user research, user flow, mock ups, and usability test.

                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Schnitzeljadg is a movie/TV show filming location finder APP. The users can use it to find certain movie/TCV show’s filming location, and find out what movies/TV shows have been shot in certain locations.
                </p>
                <h3>What is my role?</h3>
                <p>This project was part of my online UX course, hence I was responsible for the overall strategy, the UX research, information architecture, user testing, and interaction design. Throughout a couple of months study, I received valuable feedbacks
                  from my tutor Matt Kollat and my mentor Pia Klancar.

                <h3>Usalibity Test</h3>
                <p>When designing a project, I can be very focused, however, my own perspective can actually replace the users’ unconsciously. And this, can be improved by conducting a usability test.
                I did 6 usability tests, 3 face-to-face on site test, 3 remote Skype usability tests, and all of them are moderated.
                This helps me get out of my own head, and fix some sever usability problem before moving on to the next stage.
                For further design options, I also conducted A/B test to decide which one is more favoured by the users.

          <h3>Work Progress</h3>
          <h4>Low-fidelity</h4>
          <p>The paper and pen version focus on main functions.
          </p>
          <h4>Mid-fidelity</h4>
          <p>It is created in Balsamic. During this process,  I realised my former design was less a Webapp, so I corrected it in this version. My focus at this point was to make the user flow as smooth and simple as possible.
          </p>
          <h4>High fidelity, wireframe and prototyping</h4>
          <p>I created this version in Adobe XD and clickable version in InVision. I focus on perfecting the visual elements such as colour theme, grid, accessibility, in order to make the user experience more enjoyable.

          <p>Details of the conclusion
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <h4>"I Assume..."</h4>
          <p>To me, in this project, my biggest enemy is not the problem I need to solve, but assumption. Assum the users have certain problem, assume users would do things like this, assume users would love certain design, etc... I have to keep in mind, I am NOT the users. Without solid prove, I should not present any solution.
          </p>
          <h4>"Quality Persona"</h4>
          <p>When it comes to persona, it is not the more the better. One needs to find typical things, and sumon them up well.
          </p>
          <h4>"Rules" Make It Easy</h4>
          <p>By "rules", I mean : site map, style guide, test plan. When I was creating these, I thought it was just useless "bureaucratic" documentation. I did not take them seriously. But once i started to conduct usability test, or dive into the details, such as mid fidelity prototype pages, I realized the more these document is, easier the job would be.
